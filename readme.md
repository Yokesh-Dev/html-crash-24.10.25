# 💼 Project: Personal Portfolio Website (HTML Only)

### 🧠 Goal:

Build a **multi-page personal portfolio** using only **HTML**.
You’ll apply **all HTML concepts** — structure, text formatting, links, images, lists, forms, and attributes — in a real-world project.
---

## 🗂 Folder Structure

Create a folder named:

```
personal-portfolio
```

Inside it, create **4 HTML files**:

1. `index.html` – Home Page
2. `about.html` – About Me Page
3. `projects.html` – Projects Page
4. `contact.html` – Contact Page

You’ll link them together using `<a>` navigation links.
